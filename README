This repo contains a UITableViewCell category called ShrinkTo which will let
you easily shrink any cell to another view, much like the Mail app.

Demo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xak3xqGKvqc

The two files you need are UITableViewCell+ShrinkTo.h and its corresponding
.m file. The included project shows how to use the classes.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to link against the QuartzCore framework in your build
settings or you'll get linker errors when you try to compile.
